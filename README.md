# Movie Picture Pipeline


## Project Summary
You've been brought on as the DevOps resource for a development team that manages a web application that is a catalog of Movie Picture movies. They're in dire need of automating their development workflows in hopes of accelerating their release cycle. They'd like to use Github Actions to automate testing, building and deploying their applications to an existing Kubernetes cluster.

The team's project is comprised of 2 applications.

1. A frontend UI written in Typescript, using the React framework
2. A backend API written in Python using the Flask framework.

You'll find 2 folders, one named `frontend` and one named `backend`, where each application's source code is maintained. Your job is to use the team's [existing documentation](#frontend-development-notes) and create CI/CD pipelines to meet the teams' needs.

## Deliverables

### Frontend

1. A Continuous Integration workflow that:
   1. Runs on `pull_requests` against the `main` branch,only when code in the frontend application changes.
   2. Is able to be run on-demand (i.e. manually without needing to push code)
   3. Runs the following jobs in parallel:
      1. Runs a linting job that fails if the code doesn't adhere to eslint rules
      2. Runs a test job that fails if the test suite doesn't pass
   4. Runs a build job only if the lint and test jobs pass and successfully builds the application
2. A Continuous Deployment workflow that:
   1. Runs on `push` against the `main` branch, only when code in the frontend application changes.
   2. Is able to be run on-demand (i.e. manually without needing to push code)
   3. Runs the same lint/test jobs as the Continuous Integration workflow
   4. Runs a build job only when the lint and test jobs pass
      1. The built docker image should be tagged with the git sha
   5. Runs a deploy job that applies the Kubernetes manifests to the provided cluster.
      1. The manifest should deploy the newly created tagged image
      2. The tag applied to the image should be the git SHA of the commit that triggered the build

### Backend

1. A Continuous Integration workflow that:
   1. Runs on `pull_requests` against the `main` branch,only when code in the frontend application changes.
   2. Is able to be run on-demand (i.e. manually without needing to push code)
   3. Runs the following jobs in parallel:
      1. Runs a linting job that fails if the code doesn't adhere to eslint rules
      2. Runs a test job that fails if the test suite doesn't pass
   4. Runs a build job only if the lint and test jobs pass and successfully builds the application
2. A Continuous Deployment workflow that:
   1. Runs on `push` against the `main` branch, only when code in the frontend application changes.
   2. Is able to be run on-demand (i.e. manually without needing to push code)
   3. Runs the same lint/test jobs as the Continuous Integration workflow
   4. Runs a build job only when the lint and test jobs pass
      1. The built docker image should be tagged with the git sha
   5. Runs a deploy job that applies the Kubernetes manifests to the provided cluster.
      1. The manifest should deploy the newly created tagged image
      2. The tag applied to the image should be the git SHA of the commit that triggered the build


**⚠️ NOTE**
Once you begin work on Continuous Deployment, you'll need to first setup the AWS and Kubernetes environment.
